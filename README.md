Basic game of Rock/Paper/Scissors


The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissor game in JavaScript.
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal is quite simple, the user provides their guess as
input which is then compared to a randomly generated guess 
from the computer. In the event of a tie the round is replayed
until a winner is defined. 

The game ends after 5 rounds, to then the user is prompted
with a question to play again. If yes is entered the game 
restarts, if not the game ends.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Still to-do
-----------------------------------------------------------

I still need to implement a score variable to store the 
point for the round winner. Then a function that compares 
the the total user points to computer points to decide 
the game winner.

I will also be adding a GUI in the near future.
