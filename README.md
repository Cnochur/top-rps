Basic game of Rock/Paper/Scissors


The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissor game in JavaScript.
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal is quite simple, the user provides their guess as
input which is then compared to a randomly generated guess 
from the computer. In the event of a tie the round is replayed
until a winner is defined. 

The game ends after either player wins 5 points, repeating 
the point if a tie happens.

I have learned a lot building this project:

- My knowledge of java grew deeper.
- My knowledge of git became better learning how to branch, pull (slightly) and merge onto the main.

Still to-do

When tie happens make aware on display.
