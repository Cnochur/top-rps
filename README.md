Basic game of Rock/Paper/Scissors


The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissor game in JavaScript.
-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal is quite simple, the user provides their guess as
input which is then compared to a randomly generated guess 
from the computer. In the event of a tie the round is replayed
until a winner is defined. 

The game ends after 5 rounds, announcing the winner and final score.

Still to-do

I will also be adding a GUI in the near future.
